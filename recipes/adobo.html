    <ol>
      <li>
        Marinate the chicken in soy sauce and garlic in a large

        the better.

      <li>
        Pour cooking oil in a pot and let it heat up
      </li>
      <li>
        When the oil is hot enough, pan-fry the marinated chicken
        for 2 minutes per side.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour-in the remaining marinade, including garlic.
        Add water and bring to a boil
      </li>
      <li>
        Add dried bay leaves and whole peppercorn. Let simmer for
        3 minutes or until the chicken gets tender
      </li>
      <li>
        Add vinegar and let it cook for 10 minutes (or until
        the water has reduced to your liking).
      </li>
      <li>
        Season to taste with sugar and salt, and you're ready
        to serve!
